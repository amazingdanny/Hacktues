            Broken Access Control
          </p>
          <p class="font-thin" style="font-size: 1.2vw">
            Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of
            their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized
            information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or
            performing a business function outside the user's limits. Common
            access control vulnerabilities include:
            <br />
            Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default,
            where access should only be granted for particular capabilities,
            roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
            <br />
            Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter
            tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the
            HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
            <br />
            Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing
            its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)
            <br />
            Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
            <br />
            Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or
            acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
            <br />
            Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON
            Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field
            manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.
            <br />
            CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted
            origins.
            <br />
            Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or
            to privileged pages as a standard user.
            <br />
            How do I prevent this? You should try these:
            <br />
            Except for public resources, deny access by default.
            <br />
            Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout
            the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
            (CORS) usage.
            <br />
            Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than
            accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any
            record.
            <br />
            Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by
            domain models.
            <br />
            Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g.,
            .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
            <br />
            Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g.,
            repeated failures).
            <br />
            Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from
            automated attack tooling.
            <br />
            Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server
            after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so
            that he window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized. For
            longer lived JWTs it's highly recommended to follow the OAuth
            standards to revoke access.
            <br />
            Examples of BAC attacks:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing
            account information:
            <br />
            pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
            <br />
            ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
            <br />
            An attacker simply modifies the browser's 'acct' parameter to send
            whatever account number they want. If not correctly verified, the
            attacker can access any user's account.
            <br />
            https://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
            <br />
            Scenario #2: An attacker simply forces browses to target URLs. Admin
            rights are required for access to the admin page.
            <br />
            https://example.com/app/getappInfo
            <br />
            https://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
            <br />
            If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it's a flaw. If a
            non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.

            Cryptographic Failures
          </p>
          <p class="font-thin" style="font-size: 1.2vw">
            Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which is more of a
            broad symptom rather than a root cause, the focus is on failures
            related to cryptography (or lack thereof). Which often lead to
            exposure of sensitive data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations
            (CWEs) included are CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, CWE-327:
            Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm, and CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy.
            <br />
            The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in
            transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers,
            health records, personal information, and business secrets require
            extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws,
            e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or
            regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data
            Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:
            <br />
            Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such
            as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External
            internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g.,
            between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.
            <br />
            Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used
            either by default or in older code?
            <br />
            Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or
            re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto
            keys checked into source code repositories?
            <br />
            Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser)
            security directives or headers missing?
            <br />
            Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly
            validated?
            <br />
            Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated
            sufficiently secure for the cryptographic mode of operation? Is an
            insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption used
            when authenticated encryption is more appropriate?
            <br />
            Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a
            password base key derivation function?
            <br />
            Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed
            to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is
            chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has
            the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built
            into it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability?
            <br />
            Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are
            non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash
            functions are needed?
            <br />
            Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1
            v1.5 in use?
            <br />
            Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information
            exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks?
            <br />
            How do I prevent this? You can try this:
            <br />
            Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application.
            Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws,
            regulatory requirements, or business needs.
            <br />
            Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as
            possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation.
            Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
            <br />
            Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
            <br />
            Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and
            keys are in place; use proper key management.
            <br />
            Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with
            forward secrecy (FS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server,
            and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP
            Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
            <br />
            Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.
            <br />
            Apply required security controls as per the data classification.
            <br />
            Do not use legacy protocols such as FTP and SMTP for transporting
            sensitive data.
            <br />
            Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions
            with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or
            PBKDF2.
            <br />
            Initialization vectors must be chosen appropriate for the mode of
            operation. For many modes, this means using a CSPRNG
            (cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator). For modes
            that require a nonce, then the initialization vector (IV) does not
            need a CSPRNG. In all cases, the IV should never be used twice for a
            fixed key.
            <br />
            Always use authenticated encryption instead of just encryption.
            <br />
            Keys should be generated cryptographically randomly and stored in
            memory as byte arrays. If a password is used, then it must be
            converted to a key via an appropriate password base key derivation
            function.
            <br />
            Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate, and
            that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low
            entropy. Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the
            CSPRNG to get security.
            <br />
            Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and padding schemes, such
            as MD5, SHA1, PKCS number 1 v1.5.
            <br />
            Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and
            settings.
            <br />
            Example of such attacks:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using
            automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically
            decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve
            credit card numbers in clear text.
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            A site doesn't use or enforce TLS for all pages or supports weak
            encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g., at an
            insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to
            HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's session cookie. The
            attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user's
            (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the user's private
            data. Instead of the above they could alter all transported data,
            e.g., the recipient of a money transfer.
            <br />
            Scenario #3:
            <br />
            The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store
            everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to
            retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be
            exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes. Hashes
            generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by GPUs,
            even if they were salted.

          <p class="font-thin" style="font-size: 1.2vw">
            94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with
            a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3%, and
            274k occurrences.
            <br />
            An application is vulnerable to attack when:
            <br />
            User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the
            application.
            <br />
            Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware
            escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
            <br />
            Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search
            parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
            <br />
            Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command
            contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries,
            commands, or stored procedures.
            <br />
            Some of the more common injections are:
            <br />
            SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and
            Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL)
            injection.
            <br />
            The concept is identical among all interpreters. Source code review
            is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to
            injections. Automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL,
            cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged.
            Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and
            interactive (IAST) application security testing tools into the CI/CD
            pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production
            deployment.
            <br />
            How do i prevent this?
            <br />
            Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from commands
            and queries:
            <br />
            The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids using the
            interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or
            migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
            <br />
            Note: Even when parameterized, stored procedures can still introduce
            SQL injection if PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates queries and data or
            executes hostile data with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec().
            <br />
            Use positive server-side input validation. This is not a complete
            defense as many applications require special characters, such as
            text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
            <br />
            For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using
            the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
            <br />
            Note: SQL structures such as table names, column names, and so on
            cannot be escaped, and thus user-supplied structure names are
            dangerous. This is a common issue in report-writing software.
            <br />
            Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass
            disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            An application uses untrusted data in the construction of the
            following vulnerable SQL call: String query = "SELECT \* FROM
            accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            Similarly, an application's blind trust in frameworks may result in
            queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g., Hibernate Query Language
            (HQL)): Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("FROM accounts WHERE
            custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'");
            <br />
            In both cases, the attacker modifies the "id" parameter value in
            their browser to send: ' UNION SLEEP(10);--. For example:
            <br />
            http://example.com/app/accountView?id=' UNION SELECT SLEEP(10);--
            <br />
            This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the records
            from the accounts table. More dangerous attacks could modify or
            delete data or even invoke stored procedures.

            <br />
            The application might be vulnerable if the application is:
            <br />
            Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the
            application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud
            services.
            <br />
            Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary
            ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).
            <br />
            Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and
            unchanged.
            <br />
            Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative
            error messages to users.
            <br />
            For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or
            not configured securely.
            <br />
            The security settings in the application servers, application
            frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases,
            etc., are not set to secure values.
            <br />
            The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are
            not set to secure values.
            <br />
            The software is out of date or vulnerable (see A06:2021-Vulnerable

            <br />
            Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration
            process, systems are at a higher risk.
            <br />
            How do I prevent this?
            <br />
            Secure installation processes should be implemented, including:
            <br />
            A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy
            another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development,
            QA, and production environments should all be configured
            identically, with different credentials used in each environment.
            This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to
            set up a new secure environment.
            <br />
            A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components,
            documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features

            <br />
            A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all

            <br />
            A segmented application architecture provides effective and secure

            <br />
            Sending security directives to clients, e.g., Security Headers.
            <br />
            An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the
            configurations and settings in all environments.
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            The application server comes with sample applications not removed
            from the production server. These sample applications have known
            security flaws attackers use to compromise the server. Suppose one
            of these applications is the admin console, and default accounts
            weren't changed. In that case, the attacker logs in with default
            passwords and takes over.
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            Directory listing is not disabled on the server. An attacker
            discovers they can simply list directories. The attacker finds and
            downloads the compiled Java classes, which they decompile and
            reverse engineer to view the code. The attacker then finds a severe
            access control flaw in the application.
            <br />
            Scenario #3:
            <br />
            The application server's configuration allows detailed error
            messages, e.g., stack traces, to be returned to users. This
            potentially exposes sensitive information or underlying flaws such
            as component versions that are known to be vulnerable.
            <br />
            Scenario #4:
            <br />
            A cloud service provider (CSP) has default sharing permissions open
            to the Internet by other CSP users. This allows sensitive data
            stored within cloud storage to be accessed.

            Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a
            default exploits/impact weight of 5.0 is used.
            <br />
            You are likely vulnerable:
            <br />
            If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both
            client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly
            use as well as nested dependencies.
            <br />
            If the software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This
            includes the OS, web/application server, database management system
            (DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments,
            and libraries.
            <br />
            If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to
            security bulletins related to the components you use.
            <br />
            If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks,
            and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly
            happens in environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task
            under change control, leaving organizations open to days or months
            of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.
            <br />
            If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated,
            upgraded, or patched libraries.
            <br />
            If you do not secure the components' configurations
            <br />
            How do I prevent this?
            <br />
            There should be a patch management process in place to:
            <br />
            Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files,
            and documentation.
            <br />
            Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and
            server-side components (e.g., frameworks, libraries) and their
            dependencies using tools like versions, OWASP Dependency Check,
            retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like Common
            Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability
            Database (NVD) for vulnerabilities in the components. Use software
            composition analysis tools to automate the process. Subscribe to
            email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you
            use.
            <br />
            Only obtain components from official sources over secure links.
            Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified,
            malicious component (See A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity
            Failures).
            <br />
            Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not
            create security patches for older versions. If patching is not
            possible, consider deploying a virtual patch to monitor, detect, or
            protect against the discovered issue.
            <br />
            Every organization must ensure an ongoing plan for monitoring,
            triaging, and applying updates or configuration changes for the
            lifetime of the application or portfolio.
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1: Components typically run with the same privileges as
            the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in
            serious impact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g., coding error) or
            intentional (e.g., a backdoor in a component). Some example
            exploitable component vulnerabilities discovered are:
            <br />
            CVE-2017-5638, a Struts 2 remote code execution vulnerability that
            enables the execution of arbitrary code on the server, has been
            blamed for significant breaches.
            <br />
            While the internet of things (IoT) is frequently difficult or
            impossible to patch, the importance of patching them can be great
            (e.g., biomedical devices).
            <br />
            There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched or
            misconfigured systems. For example, the Shodan IoT search engine can
            help you find devices that still suffer from Heartbleed
            vulnerability patched in April 2014.

            Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session
            management is critical to protect against authentication-related
            attacks. There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
            <br />
            Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the
            attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.
            <br />
            Permits brute force or other automated attacks.

            You can try this:
            <br />
            Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to prevent
            automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential
            reuse attacks.
            <br />
            Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for
            admin users.
            <br />
            Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed
            passwords against the top 10,000 worst passwords list.
            <br />
            Align password length, complexity, and rotation policies with
            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-63b's
            guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other modern,
            evidence-based password policies.
            <br />
            Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are
            hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same
            messages for all outcomes.
            <br />
            Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts, but be careful
            not to create a denial of service scenario. Log all failures and
            alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or other
            attacks are detected.
            <br />
            Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a
            new random session ID with high entropy after login. Session
            identifier should not be in the URL, be securely stored, and
            invalidated after logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            Credential stuffing, the use of lists of known passwords, is a
            common attack. Suppose an application does not implement automated
            threat or credential stuffing protection. In that case, the
            application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the
            credentials are valid.
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            Most authentication attacks occur due to the continued use of
            passwords as a sole factor. Once considered best practices, password
            rotation and complexity requirements encourage users to use and
            reuse weak passwords. Organizations are recommended to stop these
            practices per NIST 800-63 and use multi-factor authentication.
            <br />
            Scenario #3:
            <br />
            Application session timeouts aren't set correctly. A user uses a
            public computer to access an application. Instead of selecting
            "logout," the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away. An
            attacker uses the same browser an hour later, and the user is still
            authenticated.

          <p class="font-thin" style="font-size: 1.2vw">
            Focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, with a
            call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and
            reference architectures. As a community we need to move beyond
            "shift-left" in the coding space to pre-code activities that are
            critical for the principles of Secure by Design.
            <br />
            Insecure design is a broad category representing different
            weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”
            Insecure design is not the source for all other Top 10 risk
            categories. There is a difference between insecure design and
            insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and
            implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes
            and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation
            defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An
            insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by
            definition, needed security controls were never created to defend
            against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to
            insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in
            the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to
            determine what level of security design is required.
            <br />
            Requirements and Resource management: Collect and negotiate the
            business requirements for an application with the business,
            including the protection requirements concerning confidentiality,
            integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data assets and the
            expected business logic. Take into account how exposed your
            application will be and if you need segregation of tenants
            (additionally to access control). Compile the technical
            requirements, including functional and non-functional security
            requirements. Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design,
            build, testing, and operation, including security activities.
            <br />
            Secure design: Secure design is a culture and methodology that
            constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is robustly
            designed and tested to prevent known attack methods. Threat modeling
            should be integrated into refinement sessions (or similar
            activities); look for changes in data flows and access control or
            other security controls. In the user story development determine the
            correct flow and failure states, ensure they are well understood and
            agreed upon by responsible and impacted parties. Analyze assumptions
            and conditions for expected and failure flows, ensure they are still
            accurate and desirable. Determine how to validate the assumptions
            and enforce conditions needed for proper behaviors. Ensure the
            results are documented in the user story. Learn from mistakes and
            offer positive incentives to promote improvements. Secure design is
            neither an add-on nor a tool that you can add to software.
            <br />
            Secure development lifecycle: Secure software requires a secure
            development lifecycle, some form of secure design pattern, paved
            road methodology, secured component library, tooling, and threat
            modeling. Reach out for your security specialists at the beginning
            of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance
            of your software.
            <br />
            How do i prevent this?
            <br />
            You can try this:
            <br />
            Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec
            professionals to help evaluate and design security and
            privacy-related controls
            <br />
            Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road
            ready to use components
            <br />
            Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control,
            business logic, and key flows
            <br />
            Integrate security language and controls into user stories
            <br />
            Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application (from
            frontend to backend)
            <br />
            Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows
            are resistant to the threat model. Compile use-cases and
            misuse-cases for each tier of your application.
            <br />
            Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending on
            the exposure and protection needs
            <br />
            Segregate tenants robustly by design throughout all tiers
            <br />
            Limit resource consumption by user or service
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            A credential recovery workflow might include “questions and
            answers,” which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and
            the OWASP Top 10. Questions and answers cannot be trusted as
            evidence of identity as more than one person can know the answers,
            which is why they are prohibited. Such code should be removed and
            replaced with a more secure design.
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            A cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a maximum of
            fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers could threat
            model this flow and test if they could book six hundred seats and
            all cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive loss of
            income.
            <br />
            Scenario #3:
            <br />
            A retail chain's e-commerce website does not have protection against
            bots run by scalpers buying high-end video cards to resell auction
            websites. This creates terrible publicity for the video card makers
            and retail chain owners and enduring bad blood with enthusiasts who
            cannot obtain these cards at any price. Careful anti-bot design and
            domain logic rules, such as purchases made within a few seconds of
            availability, might identify inauthentic purchases and rejected such
            transactions.

            Security logging and monitring failures
          </p>
          <p class="font-thin" style="font-size: 1.2vw">
            Logging and monitoring can be challenging to test, often involving
            interviews or asking if attacks were detected during a penetration
            test. There isn't much CVE/CVSS data for this category, but
            detecting and responding to breaches is critical. Still, it can be
            very impactful for accountability, visibility, incident alerting,
            and forensics.
            <br />
            Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected.
            Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response
            occurs any time:
            <br />
            Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value
            transactions, are not logged.
            <br />
            Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log
            messages.
            <br />
            Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious
            activity.
            <br />
            Logs are only stored locally.
            <br />
            Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes
            are not in place or effective.
            <br />
            Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security
            testing (DAST) tools (such as OWASP ZAP) do not trigger alerts.
            <br />
            The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks
            in real-time or near real-time.
            <br />
            You are vulnerable to information leakage by making logging and
            alerting events visible to a user or an attacker.
            <br />
            How do I prevent this?
            <br />
            Developers should implement some or all the following controls,
            depending on the risk of the application:
            <br />
            Ensure all login, access control, and server-side input validation
            failures can be logged with sufficient user context to identify
            suspicious or malicious accounts and held for enough time to allow
            delayed forensic analysis.
            <br />
            Ensure that logs are generated in a format that log management
            solutions can easily consume.
            <br />
            Ensure log data is encoded correctly to prevent injections or
            attacks on the logging or monitoring systems.
            <br />
            Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity
            controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append-only
            database tables or similar.
            <br />
            DevSecOps teams should establish effective monitoring and alerting
            such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to
            quickly.
            <br />
            Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan, such as
            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-61r2 or
            later.
            <br />
            There are commercial and open-source application protection
            frameworks such as the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and
            open-source log correlation software, such as the Elasticsearch,
            Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack, that feature custom dashboards and
            alerting.
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1:
            <br />
            A children's health plan provider's website operator couldn't detect
            a breach due to a lack of monitoring and logging. An external party
            informed the health plan provider that an attacker had accessed and
            modified thousands of sensitive health records of more than 3.5
            million children. A post-incident review found that the website
            developers had not addressed significant vulnerabilities. As there
            was no logging or monitoring of the system, the data breach could
            have been in progress since 2013, a period of more than seven years.
            <br />
            Scenario #2:
            <br />
            A major Indian airline had a data breach involving more than ten
            years' worth of personal data of millions of passengers, including
            passport and credit card data. The data breach occurred at a
            third-party cloud hosting provider, who notified the airline of the
            breach after some time.
            <br />
            Scenario #3:
            <br />
            A major European airline suffered a GDPR reportable breach. The
            breach was reportedly caused by payment application security
            vulnerabilities exploited by attackers, who harvested more than
            400,000 customer payment records. The airline was fined 20 million
            pounds as a result by the privacy regulator.

            SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote
            resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an
            attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an
            unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or
            another type of network access control list (ACL).
            <br />
            As modern web applications provide end-users with convenient
            features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the
            incidence of SSRF is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is
            becoming higher due to cloud services and the complexity of
            architectures.
            <br />
            How do I prevent this?
            <br />
            Developers can prevent SSRF by implementing some or all the
            following defense in depth controls:
            <br />
            From Network layer:
            <br />
            Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks to
            reduce the impact of SSRF
            <br />
            Enforce “deny by default” firewall policies or network access
            control rules to block all but essential intranet traffic.
            <br />
            Hints:
            <br />
            ~ Establish an ownership and a lifecycle for firewall rules based on
            applications.
            <br />
            ~ Log all accepted and blocked network flows on firewalls
            <br />
            From Application layer:
            <br />
            Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data
            <br />
            Enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow
            list
            <br />
            Do not send raw responses to clients
            <br />
            Disable HTTP redirections
            <br />
            Be aware of the URL consistency to avoid attacks such as DNS
            rebinding and “time of check, time of use” (TOCTOU) race conditions
            <br />
            Do not mitigate SSRF via the use of a deny list or regular
            expression. Attackers have payload lists, tools, and skills to
            bypass deny lists.
            <br />
            Additional Measures to consider:
            <br />
            Don't deploy other security relevant services on front systems (e.g.
            OpenID). Control local traffic on these systems (e.g. localhost).
            <br />
            For frontends with dedicated and manageable user groups use network
            encryption (e.g. VPNs) on independent systems to consider very high
            protection needs.

            Focuses on making assumptions related to software updates, critical

            highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and
            Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data.
            <br />
            Software and data integrity failures relate to code and
            infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
            An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins,
            libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and
            content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can
            introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or
            system compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update
            functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient
            integrity verification and applied to the previously trusted
            application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to
            be distributed and run on all installations. Another example is
            where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure
            that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure
            deserialization.
            <br />
            How do I prevent this?
            <br />
            You can try this:
            <br />
            Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software
            or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.
            <br />
            Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as npm or Maven, are
            consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile,
            consider hosting an internal known-good repository that's vetted.
            <br />
            Ensure that a software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP
            Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used to verify that
            components do not contain known vulnerabilities
            <br />
            Ensure that there is a review process for code and configuration
            changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration
            could be introduced into your software pipeline.
            <br />
            Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation,
            configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the
            code flowing through the build and deploy processes.
            <br />
            Ensure that unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to
            untrusted clients without some form of integrity check or digital
            signature to detect tampering or replay of the serialized data
            <br />
            Example attack scenarios:
            <br />
            Scenario #1
            <br />
            Update without signing: Many home routers, set-top boxes, device
            firmware, and others do not verify updates via signed firmware.
            Unsigned firmware is a growing target for attackers and is expected
            to only get worse. This is a major concern as many times there is no
            mechanism to remediate other than to fix in a future version and
            wait for previous versions to age out.
            <br />
            Scenario #2
            <br />
            SolarWinds malicious update: Nation-states have been known to attack
            update mechanisms, with a recent notable attack being the SolarWinds
            Orion attack. The company that develops the software had secure
            build and update integrity processes. Still, these were able to be
            subverted, and for several months, the firm distributed a highly
            targeted malicious update to more than 18,000 organizations, of
            which around 100 or so were affected. This is one of the most
            far-reaching and most significant breaches of this nature in
            history.
            <br />
            Scenario #3
            <br />
            Insecure Deserialization: A React application calls a set of Spring
            Boot microservices. Being functional programmers, they tried to
            ensure that their code is immutable. The solution they came up with
            is serializing the user state and passing it back and forth with
            each request. An attacker notices the "rO0" Java object signature
            (in base64) and uses the Java Serial Killer tool to gain remote code
            execution on the application server.
